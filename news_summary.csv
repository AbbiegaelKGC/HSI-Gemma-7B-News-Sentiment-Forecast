And a big part of that is the idea that each student has his or her own style in the way they approach learning and engage with the material being taught.    “It is a combination that lets students move fully and freely between American schools and internationally, and it helps the transition into universities in the US and around the world,” says Ron Roukema, interim head of school at HKIS. “And the framework we use allows latitude in teaching different topics based on abilities and what works best.”  The starting point, when it comes to course content, is the US common core curriculum, which sets clear standards and expectations for each grade. Where appropriate, though, HKIS also incorporates elements from the C3 framework for social studies covering civics, history, geography, economics, and inquiry skills, and from the New Generation Science Standards.  This flexibility makes it possible to promote excellence, explore connections, make classes more experiential, and stay relevant in the context of Hong Kong and Asia.   “Our teachers create a learning environment that replicates situations which are current and meaningful,” says Roukema, noting for example that a literature course for seniors isn’t limited to Shakespeare, but can include stories from Vietnam, China, or around the region. “From kindergarten to Grade 12, the curriculum is aligned to provide the building blocks, concepts and skills needed for a well-rounded education in science, mathematics, liberal arts, coding and much more.”   These days, he points out, the teacher’s role is no longer to be the “sage on stage” who stands at the…",none
